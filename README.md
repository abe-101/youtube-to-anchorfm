# Youtube to Anchor.fm - An automation tool to publish your podcast

![Cover image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Schrodinger-Hat/youtube-to-anchorfm/main/assets/img/cover.png "Cover image")

This action will upload an audio file from a given youtube video automatically to your Anchor.fm account.

It is very useful in a scenario where you have a YouTube account and also a podcast over Spotify, Anchor.fm, Play Music, iTunes etc.

In our live show (Schrodinger Hat) we had this necessity. So we built it for the open source community.

Every contribution it is appreciated, also a simple feedback.

## How it works

The workflow is using `youtube-dl` library and `puppeteer`.

The first one is a npm module used for donwloading the video / audio from YouTube, meanwhile Puppeteer will upload the generated file into the Anchor.fm dashboard (by loggin it).

The action will start everytime you push a change on the `episode.json` file. Into this file you need to specify the youtube id of your video.

The action use a docker image built over ubuntu 18.04. It take some times to setup the environment (installing dependecies and chromium browser).

## How can I use it?

You can use the latest version of this action from the [Github Actions marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/upload-episode-from-youtube-to-anchor-fm).

In your repository root directory you should add a `episode.json` file containing your youtube video id, e.g:
```json
{
  "id": "nHCXZC2InAA"
}
```

Then you can add under the `.github/workflows` directory this yml:

```yaml
name: 'Upload Episode from YouTube To Anchor.Fm'

on:
  push:
    paths: 
      - episode.json
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  upload_episode:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Upload Episode from YouTube To Anchor.Fm
        uses: Schrodinger-Hat/youtube-to-anchorfm@v1.0.1
        env:
          ANCHOR_EMAIL: ${{ secrets.ANCHOR_EMAIL }}
          ANCHOR_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.ANCHOR_PASSWORD }}
          EPISODE_PATH: /github/workspace
```

**NOTE**: you need to [set up the secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) for *ANCHOR_EMAIL* and *ANCHOR_PASSWORD*. This environment variables are mandatory as they specify the signin account.

## Process a YouTube playlist

Right now, you can process a full playlist (one way only) with

```
curl https://scc-youtube.vercel.app/playlist-items/PLoXdlLuaGN8ShASxcE2A4YuSto3AblDmX \
    | jq '.[].contentDetails.videoId' -r \
    | tac \
    | xargs -I% bash -c "jo id='%' > episode.json && git commit -am % && git push"
```

`https://scc-youtube.vercel.app/playlist-items` is from https://github.com/ThatGuySam/youtube-json-server

`jo` is a json generator https://github.com/jpmens/jo

`tac` is a command present in most linuxes and on mac with brew install coreutils. Its from reversing the list from older to newer. Remove if you want to upload in the order presented on youtube.

`jq` is a json processor https://stedolan.github.io/jq/

This must be run on the folder where your episode.json is.

## Draft Mode

By setting the `SAVE_AS_DRAFT`, the new episode will be published as a draft. This can be useful if you need someone else's
approval before actual publication.

```yaml
env:
   SAVE_AS_DRAFT: true
```

## Audio conversion options

ffmpeg is used to convert the video to MP3. It's possible to pass arguments to ffmpeg with `POSTPROCESSOR_ARGS` enviroment
variable.

See `-postprocessor-args` syntax and options on https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#post-processing-options.

The example below convert the video to mono audio.

```yaml
env:
   POSTPROCESSOR_ARGS: "ffmpeg:-ac 1"
```

## Explicit Mode

By setting the `IS_EXPLICIT`, the new episode will be marked as explicit.
```yaml
env:
   IS_EXPLICIT: true
```

## Thumbnail Mode

By setting the `LOAD_THUMBNAIL`, the new episode will include the video thumbnail as the episode art.
```yaml
env:
   LOAD_THUMBNAIL: true
```
